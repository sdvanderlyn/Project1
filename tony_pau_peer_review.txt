1. I like the fitness theme, the information the website contains is nice as well.

2a. The colors on your site compared to mine are a bit colorful and don't fit well together in my opinion. I suggest using some kind of color palette online.
2b. You should make use of white space, especially on the home and workouts page to emphasize what your audience should look at.

3. Code looks well structured for the most part, but there are some lines that aren't consistent.
    link tags should be indented on lines 3,4 in index.html, diets.html, about-page.html, blog.html, and workouts.html
    There are a lot of <br> tags which I understand helps format your text properly, but it makes the site hard to maintain and update later on.

4a. Lots of glaring typos, perhaps use Code Spell Checker on VSCode
4b. Workout page is cool conceptually but you really should avoid unnecessary animation and text on images. This is basically impossible for a screenreader to read, and it's bad that I have to wait some seconds to hover over it at the right time to read the list properly.
4c. Not a fan of the dashed border for the navbar, it implies that I should cut it out like its some kind of coupon.
4d. Change the font up a bit, having some sans-serif font will make your site look cleaner and more modern.
4e. Keep your images consistent, on diet.html you have a Just Egg image that has a background while the others do not. Images are slightly out of alignment on the home page.
